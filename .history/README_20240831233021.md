# Statement
Since there are tons of new papers on related topic in many conferences, we may miss some papers.
You are always welcomed to submit a pull request for the related and unlisted papers on debias ML, which are published on peer-review conferences (SIGIR/WWW/AAAI/KDD etc.) or released on arXiv.

## Overview of Bias in Recommender Systems

|Category|Subtype|Stages in the loop|Cause|Effect|Major Solutions|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Data Bias**|<a href="#SB">Selection Bias</a>|Use→Data|users' self-selection|skewed observed rating distribution|Data Imputation;Propensity Score;Joint Generative  Model;Doubly Robust Model|
|**Data Bias**|<a href="#EB">Exposure  Bias</a>|User→️Data|item popularity;intervened by systems;User behavior and background|unobserved  interactions do not mean negative|Giving confidence weights by heuristic, sampling or exposure-based model;Propensity score;Causality-based Model|
|**Data Bias**|Conformity Bias|User→️Data|conformity|skewed interaction labels|Modeling social or popularity effect|
|**Data Bias**|Position Bias|User→️Data|trust top of lists;exposed to top of lists|unreliable positive data|click models;Propensity Score;Trust-aware Model|
|**Model Bias**|Inductive Bias|Data→️Model|researchers  or engineers created|better generalization,lower variance or faster recommendation|-|
